# tomy2000
A modern upgrade of the vintage Omnibot 2000 using Raspberry Pi 5, Arduino Nano, sensors, servos, and a touchscreen UI. Tomy blends retro design with modern robotics for expressive movement, Wi-Fi control, and interactive features. Open-source, modular, and built to inspire makers and tinkerers.

ðŸ¦¾ Tomy: A Retro Robot Reimagined with Modern Tech

Tomy is a personal robotics restoration and reinvention project built on the vintage Omnibot 2000 platform. This repo documents the full transformation of Tomy into a fully programmable, Wi-Fi-connected robot powered by a Raspberry Pi 5, microcontrollers, servos, sensors, and a capacitive touchscreen interface.

The project blends retro-futurism with modern robotics, aiming to create an expressive, interactive, and modular home robot that can evolve over time.
